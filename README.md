# Electric Skateboard

The electric skateboard project was my design for an electric longboard. I designed a belt driven system for standard boards and trucks so the system could be an add on to any standard board.  

As of now, the repository contains all of the CAD files for the design. Electrical and software updates soon to come once I start building the system. Along with this, planning on changing the belt drive design to accomedate off the self parts or to make parts easier to DIY.
